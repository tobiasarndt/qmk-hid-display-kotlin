# qmk-hid-display-kotlin

I build this to display my current playing spotify song and the current time on the display of my qmk keyboard. Refer to my [layout](https://github.com/tobiasarndt/qmk_firmware/tree/7a128315ccd742d1f681d4313462be271a65b88e/keyboards/jorne/keymaps/tobiasarndt)
on how to implement this in your keymap. For the font i used for the clock it is necessary to merge thi [PR](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/pull/18406)
to allow for bitmaps with more than 255 characters.
